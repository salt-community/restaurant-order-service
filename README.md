# 🍲 🥟 Restaurant Order Service  📝 🚚
## Introduction
As part of an upskill project in Apache Kafka we will be creating a restaurant order service.
We are still in the development stage of this project.

This is 1 of 4 microservices that together form a restaurant application. See the other three here:
- [Payment Service](https://github.com/saltsthlm/restaurant-payment-service)
- [Kitchen Service](https://github.com/saltsthlm/restaurant-kitchen-service)
- [Delivery Service](https://github.com/saltsthlm/restaurant-delivery-service)
